# Editable - Interactive JavaScript Notebook

Welcome to **Editable**, a powerful and intuitive JavaScript notebook application that enables you to explore, prototype, and learn with ease. Editable is designed to provide you with a dynamic environment where you can seamlessly integrate code, visualizations, and narrative text, similar to Python notebooks.

## Try it

You can try Editable on [josemi.xyz/editable](https://www.josemi.xyz/editable).

## Features

- **Seamless Session Storage**: Editable stores your notebooks (documents) right in your browser's session storage. Each new tab is a fresh document, and you can effortlessly switch between them. Be mindful that unsaved changes will be lost when a tab is closed.

- **Markdown Support**: Enrich your notebooks with comprehensive explanations and narratives using Markdown. Easily incorporate beautifully formatted text blocks into your documents.

- **NPM Package Integration**: Import packages directly from the NPM registry without leaving the app. This feature simplifies extending your coding capabilities and experimenting with various libraries.

- **Native React Support**: Editable natively supports React. When a cell returns a React component, it will be rendered within your notebook, allowing you to visualize and interact with your React creations in real-time.
