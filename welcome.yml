      # What is 'Editable'?


      **Editable** is an innovative JavaScript notebook application that combines the power of interactive coding, data visualization, and narrative documentation. It is designed to make JavaScript exploration, prototyping, and learning an enjoyable and interactive experience.

      ## Notebook Structure


      In **Editable**, your notebook is organized into cells. These cells can contain a mix of Markdown text (like this one!) and executable JavaScript code. This allows you to create dynamic and informative documents that bring your JavaScript code to life.

      ### Cells can execute JavaScript code


      Code cells in **Editable** can execute JavaScript code. Think of each code cell as an ES6 module. You can use `import` and `export` within a cell, and import functions from other cells. 
  - id: e18eca
    type: code
    value: |
      export const sum = (a, b) => {
          return a + b;
      };
  - id: 91752a
    type: text
    value: |
      And now you can import and use the `sum` function in another cell:
  - id: d7b0bc
    type: code
    value: |
      import {sum} from "cell:e18eca";

      return sum(5, 3);
  - id: f7b2ca
    type: text
    value: >
      Additionally, you have the flexibility to use `await` within the cell,
      allowing for asynchronous operations.

      ### Cells can render HTML


      Code cells can also render HTML content. You can generate dynamic HTML output, such as charts or data visualizations, right within your notebook. Here's an example that creates an HTML element dynamically:
  - id: "3750e1"
    type: code
    value: |
      const element = document.createElement("p");
      element.textContent = "This is an HTML element created with JavaScript.";

      return element;

      ### Cells can render React Components


      One of **Editable**'s standout features is its native support for [React](https://www.react.dev). You can create and render React components directly within a code cell, making UI prototyping and development straightforward.
  - id: f2f93b
    type: code
    value: |
      import React from "react";

      function Greeting (props) {
          return (
              <h1>Welcome to <b>{props.name}</b>!</h1>
          );
      }

      return <Greeting name="Editable" />;

      ## Cells can import packages from the NPM registry


      You can easily import packages from the NPM registry right within **Editable**. We use [esm.sh CDN](https://esm.sh/) for importing ES6 modules.
  - id: 6b6cf6
    type: code
    value: |
      import fetch from "cross-fetch";

      const getJson = url => {
          return fetch(url).then(response => response.json());
      };

      const position = await getJson("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json");
      return position.iss_position;
